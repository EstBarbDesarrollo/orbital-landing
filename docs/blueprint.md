- Accent color: A lighter shade of purple (#9966CC) to highlight key elements and CTAs.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font providing a modern and readable aesthetic.
- Use simple, outlined icons that align with the brand's identity. Icons should be purple, in similar tones to the main theme, and can be animated for visual interest.
- Maintain a clean and structured layout, dividing content into sections with clear headings and ample spacing to improve readability and visual appeal. Replicate the overall layout from the provided reference image.
- Incorporate subtle animations on hover or scroll events to enhance interactivity and engagement. Specifically, implement a card flip animation for the square images, and transitions on the computer screen interaction.
